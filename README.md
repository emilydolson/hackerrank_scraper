# hackerrank_scraper

Python script that scrapes HackerRank leaderboard and prints grades to a CSV formatted for D2L. Not at all flexible and depends on a bunch of data files that aren't here because they're private student data. You probably shouldn't try to use this as anything other than a reference for writing a similar script.
